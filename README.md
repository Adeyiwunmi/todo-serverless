### Installation
- Prerequisite: OS -> Windows 10 Home Edition or any unix system
- Once the repository has been downloaded, you will need to first install all dependencies by running `npm i`. You will need to repeat this for all `Client`, `Backend` folders.
- Also, ensure all environment variables are set up in your `~/.profile`.
- Once this is set up, you can run the command to deploy to AWS Lambda using `sls deploy -v`. This will send the code to AWS to run and set up. 
- Once complete, you will be given the URL for testing with Postman.
